# motulator
Open-Source Simulator for Motor Drives and Power Converters

Introduction
------------
This software includes simulation models for an induction motor, a synchronous reluctance motor, and a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. Furthermore, some simple control algorithms are included as examples. The motor models are simulated in the continuous-time domain while the control algorithms run in discrete time. The default solver is the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) from scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.

Usage
-----
The main folder includes two example scripts to run the simulation:

- `simulate_sensoless.py` (for motion sensorless control)
- `simulate_sensored.py` (for control with rotor speed or position feedback)

The folder `config` contains example configuration files that can be modified or used as templates for new ones. There are separate config files for a drive system and for its controller. For example, pulse-width modulation (PWM) can be enabled in the drive system config file. 

Notes
-----
This is the very first experimental version. No testing has been carried out yet. There can be bugs and misleading comments. Many interfaces will change in the later versions. The example control algorithms aim to be simple yet feasible, and they have not been optimized at all...
